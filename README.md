# laptopKnittingPatternGenerator
A small web application to be embedded as a page in a website that will automatically generate a knitting pattern for a cover for your laptop

This application caters to the fact that a lot of people who knit may be easily confused by technology and a lot of people who are more technologically inclined might be new to knitting

This application will take as input 
  - Laptop size
      - Either screen size and fill in the length and width, or take the length and width (to accomodate people who might not know what size screen they purchased and are instead measuring length and width)
  - Easy, medium, or difficult pattern

Application will output a knitting pattern for a laptop cover and photos of the assigned stitches\
  - If it gets fancy enough we could add an ai generated image of what that pattern would create but idk if AI is there yet
